<h1>Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship - Project Repository</h1>
This repository contains all the tasks completed during the Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship. Each task focuses on implementing machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems using Python. Below is a summary of each task:

<h3>Task 1: Iris Flower Classification</h3>
In this task, we built a machine learning model to classify the species of the iris flower based on its features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. We used classification algorithms like Logistic Regression and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) to predict the species with high accuracy.

<h3>Task 2: Unemployment Analysis</h3>
We conducted an in-depth analysis of unemployment rates across different countries. Using Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib, we cleaned, visualized, and analyzed unemployment data. The goal was to identify trends and factors that contribute to changes in unemployment rates.

<h3>Task 3: Car Price Prediction</h3>
In this task, we developed a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various features like year, engine size, and mileage. Using Linear Regression, we built a model that can accurately estimate the price of a car given specific attributes.

<h3>Task 4: Email Spam and Ham Detection</h3>
We implemented a classification model to detect spam emails from legitimate (ham) emails. Using  algorithms  Naive Bayes, we trained a model to classify emails with high precision and recall.

<h3> Task 5: Predicting Sales Over Advertising </h3>
Here, we built a model to predict future sales based on advertising spend across different channels (TV, radio, and newspaper). Using Linear Regression, we analyzed how each advertising channel influences sales, providing insights into optimizing marketing strategies.

Each task demonstrates core machine learning concepts, including data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
